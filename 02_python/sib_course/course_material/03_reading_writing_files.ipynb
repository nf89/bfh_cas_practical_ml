    "# Reading and writing files\n",
    "In many use cases, you will want your python code to read/write from/to files stored on your local hard drive.  \n",
    "Here are a few important points to consider when working with files:\n",
    "* do I need to read the entire dataset/file into memory?\n",
    "    * remember the table about the time a computer takes to perform various action. Accessing the hard drive is among the slower operations. \n",
    "      Reading an entire file when you only need the first few lines will be costly\n",
    "    * if you are reading a very large file, then having the entire file in memory at once may overburden your computer\n",
    "* are there concurrency issues?\n",
    "    * if another software (or even your code if you have messed up) writes to a file you are currently reading, you could run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it is for reading or for writing, operations with files occur using **file objects** (sometimes also refferred-to as file **handles**).\n",
    "File objects are created using the `open()` function, and closed using the object's `.close()` method.  \n",
    "Here is a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file in a given \"mode\" (e.g. read, writte or append).\n",
    "file = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do something with the file...\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you are done, don't forget to close the file.\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:red\">Remember to close the files you have opened, or you will encounter errors if you want to access this file again further down in your code.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### File opening modes\n",
    "When using the `open()` function, a **mode** can be passed as argument to the function. This specifies the type of access you will have on the file. For instance, the `'r'` mode will only allow to read the content of a file, and will not allow writing to it (this is useful to avoir accidental writing to the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several more modes of opening files.\n",
    "* `'r'`: open file in read-only mode.\n",
    "* `'w'`: open file in write-only mode, **overwriting** existing file with the same name.\n",
    "* `'a'`: open file in write-only mode, **appending** to existing file with the same name.\n",
    "* `'rb'`, `'wb'`, `'ab'`: same as `'r'`, `'w'` and `'a'`, but reading/writing to/from binary files (such as `.zip` or `.bmp` image files). \n",
    "  The content is read/written as bytes objects without any decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `help(open)` for a full list of modes and details about them."
