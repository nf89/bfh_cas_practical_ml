    "We are given a piece of Python script by a colleague that is supposed to work with a certain kind of data file containing information on peptides with some very strange repeat elements. These repeat elements can be approximately 20-30 amino acid long, and each element can be repeated several times per protein. To add to the complexity of this imaginary phenomenon, such proteins typically contain 3-10 different elements.\n",

Note that in the script's output file the first letter of the protein IDs are capitalized. The script, somehow(!), collected many bugs (around 10) over time before it landed into our hands.
