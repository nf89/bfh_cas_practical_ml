    "## Variables\n",
    "In python, as in many programming language, objects are stored in variables.\n",
    "* A value is assigned to a variable using the `=` sign. \n",
    "* **Warning:** unlike in mathematics, the `=` sign in python is directional: the variable name must always be on the left of the `=`, and the value to assign to the variable on the right.  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = 23    # is a valid assignment.\n",
    "  8 = b     # is NOT a valid assignment.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In python variables names must adhere to these restrictions:\n",
    "* must be composed of uppercase, lowercase letters `A-Z`, `a-z`, digits `0-9` , and the underscore character `_`.\n",
    "* the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit. E.g. `file_1` is a valid variable name, but `1_file` is not.\n",
    "* by convention, variable names starting with a single or double underscore `_`/`__` are reserved for \"special\" variables (class private attributes, \"magic\" variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **pro tip**: using explicit variable names makes your code more understandable to others, as well as you-from-the-future. For instance `input_file` is better than `iptf`."
