    "Jupyter Notebooks are made of a successions of **cells**, that contain either code or text/comments. The type of the cell can be set via the drop-down menu found at the top of the notebook (`Code`, `Markdown` or `Raw`), and determines what happens when the cell is **run**:\n",
    "* **Code** cells: the content of code cells is executed as python code.\n",
    "* **Markdown** cells: when run, these cells are rendrered as markdown text (e.g. the current cell is a Markdown cell).\n",

    "* Use `**double stars**` to **render text in bold**.\n",
    "* Use `*single stars*` or `_single underscores_` to _render text in italic_.\n",
    "* Use triple backticks \\`\\`\\` to render text as a code block (can be python or other languages), as illustated here. Note that the cell must be in edit mode for you to see the backticks.\n",
